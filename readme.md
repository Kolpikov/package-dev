# Example package development build

I had some troubles getting started with package development in **laravel 5.3**, that's why this repository was created.

# Functionality

This package boilerplate demonstrates some basic functionality usage which you can reuse for your own package development.
Such as using... 

- routes
- config files
- controllers
- views
- facades

# Something missing?

If you want me to add something just open an issue and describe your desire!
